Revamped Parse::FixedLength for parsing fixed length ascii data.
(Well, you could parse some binary fields, but you'd have to convert them
yourself after parsing them as ascii data, and so this module
becomes less useful the more you have to do that...)

TO INSTALL:
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

See the perldocs and the tests (in the t directory) for examples.

Don't worry if the subclass*.t tests don't work, I'm experimenting
with how to make a test module not show up in CPAN and yet have the
test work. If they don't work, let me know, and if possible tell me why.
