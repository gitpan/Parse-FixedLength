Revision history for Perl extension Parse::FixedLength.
5.02  Thu Jun 28 08:04:27 PDT 2001
    - Added length method and more examples, took out some temp variables to
      tighten up code and obfuscate it a bit :)
5.01  Wed Jun 27 12:06:00 PDT 2001
    - Took up the original author's offer to rewrite this module, so I've no
      idea what happened before this change, there were no other notes except
      the 0.01 entry.
    - Changed to OO style, now uses unpack instead of substr for efficiency,
      removed some features (for now?) like the predefined parsing
      constants, but added others (like optionally returning a list
      instead of a hashref).
