Revision history for Perl extension Parse::FixedLength.
5.01  Wed Jun 27 12:06:00 PDT 2001
    - Changed to OO style, now uses unpack instead of substr for efficiency,
      removed some features (for now?) like the predefined parsing
      constants, but added others (like optionally returning a list
      instead of a hashref).
