Revision history for Perl extension Parse::FixedLength.
5.15  Sun Aug 12 14:13:06 PDT 2001
    - Better error checking on default argument types in converter method.
    - Added option to not pack during convert method.
5.14  Wed Aug  1 Some time later...
    - Better error checking on start and end positions. If start is present,
      then both start and end need to be present.
5.12  Wed Aug  1 08:31:10 PDT 2001
    - More error checking, this time for duplicate fields in the format, and
      an option to get around the check.
    - Added tests for new option.
5.11  Mon Jul 30 Later on...
    - Added more tests.
    - Fixed 'no_validate' option (which wasn't documented yet anyway, along
      with the start/end validation in general. Add info to docs about this.
5.10  Mon Jul 30 08:47:49 PDT 2001
    - Fixed doc examples.
    - Added more tests.
    - Right justify with no pad character was not defaulting to space.
5.09  Fri Jul 27 Not much later...
    - Eval anonymous subs in convert() for better error reporting.
5.08  Fri Jul 27 18:31:02 PDT 2001
    - Some doc fixes.
    - Various changes after a code review with Graham Barr at TPC,
      e.g., like adding error checking, making ":" the default delimiter,
      auto-detecting the formats, and talking me into using Scalar::Util.
5.07  Thu Jul 26 12:51:11 PDT 2001
    - Slight efficiency in construction of pack string for (what I
      think is) the common case.
    - Allow converter() method to accept a hashref or arrayref as
      mapping argument.
    - Allow convert() method to accept a hash reference as input.
5.06  Wed Jul 25 10:18:57 PDT 2001
    - Added dump() method.
    - Separated converter objects from parser objects to make a better
      cleaner OO universe.
    - Cleaned up docs, added examples.
5.05  Tue Jul 24 Later in the day...
    - For right justification, if the new format is shorter than the data,
      we need to trim leading 'pad' characters, not just whitespace.
5.04  Tue Jul 24 12:31:35 PDT 2001
    - Added right-justification option.
    - Added the questionable feature of the convert method to facilitate
      converting fixed length formats along with a corresponding test.
    - Noticed the similar functionality/purpose of Data::FixedFormat.
      Oh well, make up your own mind which you'd like to use...I kind
      of like this one :)
5.03  Thu Jun 28 08:04:27 PDT 2001
    - Improved documentation.
    - Added length method and more examples, took out some temp variables to
      tighten up code and obfuscate it a bit :)
5.01  Wed Jun 27 12:06:00 PDT 2001
    - Took up the original author's offer to rewrite this module, so I've no
      idea what happened before this change, there were no other notes except
      the 0.01 entry.
    - Changed to OO style, now uses unpack instead of substr for efficiency,
      removed some features (for now?) like the predefined parsing
      constants, but added others (like optionally returning a list
      instead of a hashref).
