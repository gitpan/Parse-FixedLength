Revision history for Perl extension Parse::FixedLength.
5.06  Wed Jul 25 10:18:57 PDT 2001
    - Added dump() method.
    - Separated converter objects from parser objects to make a better
      cleaner OO universe.
    - Cleaned up docs, added examples.
5.05  Tue Jul 24 Later in the day...
    - For right justification, if the new format is shorter than the data,
      we need to trim leading 'pad' characters, not just whitespace.
5.04  Tue Jul 24 12:31:35 PDT 2001
    - Added right-justification option.
    - Added the questionable feature of the convert method to facilitate
      converting fixed length formats along with a corresponding test.
    - Noticed the similar functionality/purpose of Data::FixedFormat.
      Oh well, make up your own mind which you'd like to use...I kind
      of like this one :)
5.03  Thu Jun 28 08:04:27 PDT 2001
    - Improved documentation.
    - Added length method and more examples, took out some temp variables to
      tighten up code and obfuscate it a bit :)
5.01  Wed Jun 27 12:06:00 PDT 2001
    - Took up the original author's offer to rewrite this module, so I've no
      idea what happened before this change, there were no other notes except
      the 0.01 entry.
    - Changed to OO style, now uses unpack instead of substr for efficiency,
      removed some features (for now?) like the predefined parsing
      constants, but added others (like optionally returning a list
      instead of a hashref).
